This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.


Q1:
Q2: If you create a new class.
Q3: If you add, enroll or delete new objects. 
Q4: private Instructor tutor
Q8: Once I set a limit of 3 to the method it successfully changed but once I entered a limit greater than 3, like 10 for example the stored value didn't change.
Q9: My prediction is it will be a value of zero
Q10: It cannot be referenced from a static context. 
Q11: The error shown says tht 'class' expected.
Q13: The only valid parameter would be 0.
Q16: (a != b) && ! false
Q17: (a != b)
Q18: Once I entered a limit of 1000 and then I set a call to setValue and entered a 3 digit value, it returned the same 3 digit value in getDisplayValue.
Q19: There is no difference in the result of changing return value +""; in the getDisplayValue method.
Q20: No, this didn't surprise me as I already knew what the result was going to be. The results are like that because you read it from left to right. Meaning that in the first code you use addition (9+3) and then use the string (cat) and add it to the value.
Q21: The clock has been set to the time "00:00"
Q23: You would need to click it 100 times. To set it at 1:00 you would need to open the editor of the ClockDisplay and set it to that given time.
Q24: NumberDisplay digit;
digit = new NumberDisplay(10);
Q25: Rectangle rectangle = new rectangle();
Q26: It displays and sets the time in hours and minutes.
Q27:
